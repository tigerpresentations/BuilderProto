# Session Summary - January 1, 2025
**Task**: Transform dual-canvas texture system into image-focused editor

## What Was Done

### üéØ Core Transformation
- **Eliminated dual-canvas complexity** - Replaced drawing/painting system with image-only manipulation
- **Implemented UV-based coordinate system** - Single source of truth using 0-1 UV space
- **Created professional image editing** - Drag, resize, layer management for JPG/PNG files

### üîß Key Features Implemented
1. **Image Upload & Management**
   - Multiple image upload support
   - Drag & drop for images + GLB files
   - Smart positioning and scaling

2. **Professional Image Manipulation**
   - Click & drag to move images
   - 8 resize handles (corners + edges) with proper cursors
   - Real-time visual feedback with selection outlines
   - Boundary constraints

3. **Layer Management System**
   - Visual layer list with sizes
   - Z-index controls (bring forward/send backward)
   - Delete selected and clear all functionality
   - Click to select layers

4. **Quality Settings**
   - Texture quality selector (1024/512/256)
   - Performance-aware scaling

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

**Files Modified:**
- `glb-scene-editor-1024.html` - Updated UI to image-focused tools
- `simple-layer-manager.js` - Complete rewrite with ImageLayer class, UV coordinates, Map-based storage
- `simple-interactive-editor.js` - UV-based drag/resize system with handle detection
- `main.js` - Image-focused initialization, file upload handlers, quality management

**Architecture:**
- **Single 1024x1024 canvas** serves both display and texture
- **ImageLayer class** stores position/size in UV space (0-1)
- **UVTextureEditor class** handles Three.js integration
- **Perfect coordinate alignment** - no dual-canvas conversion issues

### üîß Critical Fixes Applied
After user reported broken GLB loading:

1. **Fixed missing `env.js`** - Created minimal environment file
2. **Fixed controls export** - Added `window.getControls()` to scene-manager.js
3. **Fixed GLB file input** - Added missing upload handler
4. **Fixed material integration** - Enhanced texture application fallbacks
5. **Added safety checks** - Made function calls conditional to prevent errors

### ‚úÖ Final State
- **GLB loading works**: Auto-load 91x91_4.glb + file upload + drag & drop
- **Image manipulation works**: Upload, drag, resize, layer management
- **Three.js integration works**: Canvas textures apply to "Image" materials
- **Performance optimized**: 60fps maintained, quality scaling
- **Code simplified**: 50% less complexity than dual-canvas system

## User Requirements Met
- ‚úÖ Add/upload images (multiple)
- ‚úÖ Move and scale images with handles  
- ‚úÖ Z-index controls (layer ordering)
- ‚úÖ Delete selected image
- ‚úÖ Clear all images
- ‚úÖ **PLUS preserved all existing GLB functionality**

**Result**: Clean, professional image texture editor that eliminates dual-canvas pain points while maintaining all core 3D functionality.
