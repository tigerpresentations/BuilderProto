## Agent System Integration

### ðŸš€ **Newly Created Specialized Agents**
Based on comprehensive project analysis, the following specialized agents have been created:

1. **`threejs-performance-researcher`**
   - **Purpose:** Three.js performance optimization and monitoring
   - **Focus Areas:** Render performance, memory leaks, GPU optimization, quality scaling
   - **Priority:** HIGH - Essential for maintaining 60fps across devices

2. **`glb-validation-researcher`**  
   - **Purpose:** GLB/GLTF asset validation and optimization
   - **Focus Areas:** Material analysis, geometry optimization, asset compatibility
   - **Priority:** HIGH - Critical for user-uploaded model reliability

3. **`canvas-texture-researcher`**
   - **Purpose:** Canvas texture pipeline enhancement
   - **Focus Areas:** Advanced brush tools, layer systems, undo/redo functionality
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Core feature enhancement

4. **`threejs-testing-researcher`**
   - **Purpose:** WebGL/Three.js testing methodologies
   - **Focus Areas:** Cross-browser compatibility, mobile validation, regression testing
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM - Quality assurance and reliability

5. **`deployment-devops-researcher`**
   - **Purpose:** Deployment and build optimization
   - **Focus Areas:** Netlify optimization, asset bundling, CDN strategies
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM - Performance and deployment efficiency

### ðŸ“‹ **Agent Utilization Strategy**

**Immediate Use Cases:**
- Bug fixing and performance issues (threejs-performance-researcher)
- Model compatibility problems (glb-validation-researcher) 
- Texture editing enhancements (canvas-texture-researcher)

**Development Workflow Integration:**
- Agents can be invoked for specific technical challenges
- Research-focused approach maintains project simplicity philosophy
- Documentation-first approach for sustainable development

## Technical Architecture Notes

### **Current Module Structure:**
```
glb-scene-editor-1024.html (main entry)
â”œâ”€â”€ main.js (initialization & performance)
â”œâ”€â”€ scene-manager.js (Three.js scene setup)
â”œâ”€â”€ model-loader.js (GLB loading & material detection)
â”œâ”€â”€ canvas-editor.js (texture editing pipeline)
â”œâ”€â”€ layer-manager.js (canvas layer system)
â”œâ”€â”€ ui-controls.js (UI panels & interactions)
â””â”€â”€ auth.js (Supabase authentication)
```

### **Key Design Principles Maintained:**
- âœ… No build system complexity (vanilla JS/HTML/CSS)
- âœ… Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns  
- âœ… Performance-first approach with device adaptation
- âœ… Simple, practical solutions over over-engineering
- âœ… Direct Three.js integration without abstraction layers

## Next Development Phase

### **Ready for Bug Fixing & Enhancement:**
- Live production system provides real user feedback
- Agent system ready to assist with specific technical challenges
- Performance monitoring in place to identify bottlenecks
- Authentication system enables user-specific features

### **Recommended Agent Usage Patterns:**
1. **Performance Issues** â†’ `threejs-performance-researcher` for analysis and optimization
2. **Model Loading Problems** â†’ `glb-validation-researcher` for asset troubleshooting  
3. **Texture Editor Improvements** â†’ `canvas-texture-researcher` for feature enhancement
4. **Cross-platform Issues** â†’ `threejs-testing-researcher` for compatibility solutions
5. **Deployment Optimization** â†’ `deployment-devops-researcher` for build improvements

### **Development Velocity Multipliers:**
- Specialized agents reduce research time for complex Three.js issues
- Documentation-focused approach builds institutional knowledge
- Research agents complement hands-on development with proven solutions
