# Canvas Editor Progress Notes

## Date: 2025-08-29

### Project Overview
Developing a sophisticated GLB scene editor with advanced canvas texture editing capabilities. The system evolved from a simple 256x256 canvas-to-texture pipeline to a comprehensive 1024x1024 multi-layer image manipulation system.

## Recent Successes

### Phase 1-4: Core Implementation âœ…
Successfully implemented the complete advanced canvas editing system with:

1. **Dual-Canvas Architecture**: 
   - Display canvas (512x512) for user interaction
   - Texture canvas (1024x1024) for high-quality Three.js textures
   - Clean separation of concerns between display and rendering

2. **Multi-Layer Image System**:
   - `ImageLayer` class with full transform properties (position, scale, rotation)
   - `LayerManager` for z-ordering and rendering pipeline
   - Efficient layer rendering with proper coordinate transformations

3. **Interactive Manipulation**:
   - Click-to-select with immediate visual feedback (fixed double-render issue)
   - Drag-to-move functionality
   - 8 resize handles (corners + edges) with proper anchor points
   - Blue rotation handle above images with visual connection line
   - All transformations use intuitive anchor points

4. **Mode Management**:
   - Clean separation between DRAW and SELECT modes
   - Mode-specific UI showing/hiding
   - Appropriate cursor changes for different interactions

5. **UI Improvements**:
   - Viewport-constrained canvas sizing
   - Fixed "Choose File" button visibility in SELECT mode
   - Proper separation of draw-tools and image-tools

## Problems Learned to Avoid

### 1. Selection Rendering Issues
**Problem**: Selection outline appearing in the texture applied to 3D model
**Solution**: Use `ctx === displayCtx` instead of size comparison to explicitly exclude texture canvas from selection rendering

### 2. Inconsistent Resize Behavior
**Problem**: Resize handles had inconsistent anchor points (some from center, some from edges)
**Solution**: Complete rewrite of resize logic with proper anchor points:
- Corner handles: opposite corner as anchor, maintain aspect ratio
- Edge handles: opposite edge as anchor, single dimension only

### 3. Missing Immediate Feedback
**Problem**: Selection outline didn't appear until image was moved/resized
**Solution**: Add `layerManager.renderLayers()` immediately after selection

### 4. UI Overflow Issues
**Problem**: 768x768 canvas overflowed viewport
**Solution**: Viewport-constrained sizing with `calc(100vw - 20px - 300px)` and max-width limits

### 5. Mode Switching Confusion
**Problem**: "Choose File" button disappeared in SELECT mode
**Solution**: Separate draw-tools from image-tools, keep image upload always visible

- [ ] Memory management for disposed layers

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Phases 1-4)
The core image manipulation system is fully functional with all essential features:
- Multi-layer image management working perfectly
- All interaction modes (select, drag, resize, rotate) implemented
- Proper anchor points and constraints for intuitive behavior
- Clean separation between display and texture rendering
- Mode switching with appropriate UI changes

### ðŸš€ Ready for Next Steps (Phases 5-7)
The foundation is solid and ready for enhancement features:
- Extended canvas with boundary visualization
- Color swatch generation system
- Performance optimizations

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
Just completed fixing critical interaction bugs:
1. Selection outline no longer appears in texture (only on display)
2. Click outside canvas now deselects images
3. All resize operations use proper anchor points
4. Corner resizes maintain aspect ratio
5. Edge resizes affect single dimension only

## Technical Achievements

### Coordinate System Management
Successfully implemented dual coordinate systems with proper transformations:
```javascript
const scaleRatio = size / 512; // Normalize to display size
const x = layer.x * scaleRatio;
const y = layer.y * scaleRatio;
```

### Rotation Implementation
Clean rotation around image center with visual handle:
```javascript
const currentAngle = Math.atan2(e.offsetY - centerY, e.offsetX - centerX);
layer.rotation += currentAngle - rotationStartAngle;
```

### Aspect Ratio Preservation
Elegant solution for corner handle resizing:
```javascript
const scaleFromWidth = newWidth / layer.originalWidth;
const scaleFromHeight = newHeight / layer.originalHeight;
const newScale = Math.max(0.1, Math.min(scaleFromWidth, scaleFromHeight));
```

## Key Files Modified
- **glb-scene-editor-1024.html**: Complete implementation of advanced canvas editing system
- **Research documents**: Created comprehensive research for canvas editing, backlight effects, and high-resolution textures

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Phase 5**: Implement extended canvas features for better spatial awareness
2. **Phase 6**: Add color swatch system for quick solid color additions
3. **Phase 7**: Performance optimizations for smoother experience
4. **Additional Features** to consider:
   - Layer opacity controls
   - Layer reordering UI
   - Copy/paste functionality
   - Undo/redo system
   - Grid/snap-to-grid option
   - Export canvas as image

## Lessons for Future Development

1. **Always test selection rendering** separately on display vs texture canvas
2. **Anchor points matter** - users expect resize from opposite corner/edge
3. **Immediate feedback** is crucial - render after every selection change
4. **Mode separation** should be clear but not restrictive (keep common tools visible)
5. **Viewport constraints** prevent UI overflow issues
6. **Step-by-step implementation** prevents breaking existing functionality
