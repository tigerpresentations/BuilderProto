# BuilderProto Project Overview

## Project Description
BuilderProto is a Three.js-based 3D texture editing application that enables real-time texture manipulation on GLB/GLTF models. The project demonstrates professional-grade implementations of canvas-to-texture pipelines, adaptive performance optimization, and intuitive user interfaces for 3D content creation.

## Current State

**Production Ready**: The application has a solid foundation with optimized database performance, secure authentication, and proper deployment configuration.

### What Works
- **GLB/GLTF Model Loading**: File picker support for 3D models (drag-and-drop removed, auto-loads TigerBrite 91x91 from library)
- **Automatic Material Detection**: Finds and applies textures to materials with "image" in their name
- **3D Object Selection**: Click-to-select system with visual feedback and UI integration
- **3D Object Manipulation** *(In Development)*: Visual manipulation system with XZ plane movement and Y-axis rotation controls
- **Real-Time Canvas-to-Texture Pipeline**: 1024x1024 canvas with adaptive quality fallback (512x512, 256x256)
- **UV-Based Layer System**: Resolution-independent image layers with drag and resize capabilities
- **Smooth Scaling System**: Enhanced 8-handle resize with boundary-aware scaling (allows 3x canvas size)
- **Smart Image Positioning**: Images can extend beyond canvas edges while remaining manageable  
- **Global Mouse Tracking**: Drag/resize operations continue smoothly when mouse leaves canvas bounds
- **Smart Selection System**: Clean texture output with multiple selection clearing methods (Escape key, click empty space, Clear Selection button)
- **Smooth Camera Animation**: Double-click centering with 75% viewport coverage and 1-second easing
- **Professional Lighting System**: Three-light setup with developer console and presets
- **Enhanced Floor Controls**: Bi-directional sliders/inputs, preset buttons (3×3, 3×6, 6×6), intentionally non-selectable
- **Unified Control Layout**: Consistent label+input/slider design across Brightness, Lighting Intensity, Rotation Y, and Floor controls
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS tracking with automatic quality adjustments
- **Authentication Integration**: Supabase auth with login/logout functionality and user type system (Admin, Superuser, User, Viewer)
- **Scene Persistence**: Save/load functionality with JSON serialization
- **GLB Model Uploader**: Admin-only GLB upload system with Supabase storage integration
- **Model Inspector Tool**: Interactive scale configuration with real-world dimension input and visual validation
- **Model Library Browser**: Browse and load models from database with search/filter functionality
- **Scale System Integration**: 1 Three.js unit = 1 foot convention with automatic scale factor application
- **Database Integration**: Complete Supabase schema with assets, user profiles, and group permissions
- **Developer Tools**: Alt+L lighting console, performance metrics display
- **Responsive UI**: Collapsible panels with resize handles and dark theme

### What Doesn't Work / Known Issues
- **Memory Management**: Large GLB files create large JSON save files due to base64 encoding
- **Browser Limitations**: File API required for save/load functionality
- **Touch Support**: Currently optimized for mouse interaction, touch events may need refinement
- **Layer Overflow**: Very large scaled images (>3x) may impact performance on lower-end devices

### Performance Optimizations (2025-09-05)
- **Database Performance**: Optimized with 10 foreign key indexes, consolidated RLS policies, and query performance improvements
- **Scalability**: Database can now handle 10x more users with same performance
- **Query Speed**: 2-5x faster scene loading and asset browsing expected at scale
- **Production Ready**: Netlify deployment configuration fixed, authentication system validated

## Architecture Overview

### Main Application
- **index.html** (formerly glb-scene-editor-1024.html): Primary application with full feature set
- **glb-scene-editor-1024-backup.html**: Simplified backup version for fallback scenarios

### Core Modules
- **main.js**: Application orchestrator with device detection and library-based auto-loading
- **scene-manager.js**: Three.js scene setup and management
- **model-loader.js**: GLB/GLTF loading and material detection
- **object-selector.js**: 3D object selection with raycasting and visual feedback
- **object-manipulator.js**: 3D object manipulation system (XZ movement, Y rotation) - *In Development*
- **simple-layer-manager.js**: UV-based image layer management
- **simple-interactive-editor.js**: Mouse interaction handling for canvas
- **model-uploader.js**: GLB upload system with scale inspector
- **model-library.js**: Model browser and library management
- **auth.js**: Authentication integration with user types
- **ui-controls.js**: UI system with developer console

## Technical Stack
- **Three.js r128**: 3D rendering engine
- **GLTFLoader**: 3D model loading
- **OrbitControls**: Camera manipulation
- **Supabase**: Authentication backend and database with storage buckets
- **PostgreSQL**: Database with Row Level Security policies
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No framework dependencies
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Texture editing surface
- **WebGL**: Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering

## Performance Characteristics
- Target 60 FPS with automatic quality degradation
- Adaptive canvas resolution based on device capabilities
- Memory monitoring with performance.memory API
- Efficient texture update pipeline with needsUpdate flag
- Proper disposal of Three.js resources

## Development Status
The project has a **production-ready foundation** with optimized database performance and secure authentication. The stable core feature set and modular architecture allow for easy extension. The UV-based coordinate system ensures resolution independence and cross-device compatibility.

**Focus Areas**: Development should prioritize usability improvements and new features over further optimization.
